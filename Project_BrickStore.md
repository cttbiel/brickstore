- Apply programming knowledge in real-world scenarios.
- Learn and deepen skills in Java or Django.
- Deliver a clean and professional portfolio piece.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a functional e-commerce system prototype.
- Practice backend and frontend development with modern tools.
- Create an adaptable and scalable project for future real-world applications.
- Strengthen design, planning, and execution skills.

- 🔍 Search and filter system
- ❤️ Add to Favorites
- 🧺 Shopping cart system
- 💳 Secure Checkout (Mock or Mercado Pago)
- 📦 Order management (Admin)

## 🚀 Planned Tech Stack (To Be Decided)

| Area          | Stack A (Python)         | Stack B (Java)            |
|---------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Backend       | Django, Django REST      | Java (Spring Boot)         |
| Frontend      | React, JavaScript        | React, JavaScript          |
| Database      | PostgreSQL               | PostgreSQL                 |
| Payment API   | Mercado Pago              | Mercado Pago               |
| Hosting       | Vercel / Heroku / Render  | Vercel / Heroku / Render   |

> 💡 **Decision:** Using Java would support your academic focus on POO and real-world Java practice. Using Django would align with your teaching of Python.
